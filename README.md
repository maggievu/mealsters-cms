# mealsters-cms
Before make a pull request, go the google drive and extract the duplicator folder of our site.
Inside wp-content/themes/ (there should not be anything except index page), create a new folder called mealsters (or whatever theme name you want)
Now you can make a pull request to link this github repository to the folder you just create.
Test with Netbeans (or your favorite IDE) to see if sass's working
Done!
